# Crypto
Sample application to provide cryptographic operations using a HSM.

This application is under development. Currently supported mechanisms are follows,
  1. Key Generation
  
    1. AES key generation.
    2. RSA key pair generation.
  2. Encryption
  
    1. AES encryption.
    2. RSA encryption.
  3. Decryption
  
    1. AES decryption.
    2. RSA decryption.

Configure pkcs11Sample.properties file as required and rename the file to pkcs11.protperties.
